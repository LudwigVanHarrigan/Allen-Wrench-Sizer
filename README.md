# Allen-Wrench-Sizer
A computer vision allen wrench size measurer.

When it's finished, it will be able to detect the size of an allen wrench with a webcam a fixed distance above a well-lit white surface. At that point, it can be run on a Pi and can send messages to an Arduino to control some kind of robotic wrench sorter.

This is also my first time really using Git and GitHub, so don't judge my practices too harshly :)
