# Allen-Wrench-Sizer
A computer vision allen wrench size measurer.

It can detect the size of an allen wrench with a webcam a fixed distance above a backlit surface.
This software is purely experimental at this point; I consider WrenchLocalAreaMeasure.py to be the most developed sandbox.


This is also my first time really using Git and GitHub, so don't judge my practices too harshly :)
